From nol-rinale:
  PSOBB has an internal switch which allows the client to be set into 
  English or Japanese modes, this was the hidden switch Sega of America
  used to localize the game from Japanese.
  
  To enable it open the decompressed psobb.exe (it should be about 7MB) 
  in a hex editor and try the following:
  
  search for: 
  
  E82B91F4FF83F8017506B805000000C385C0750333C0C3B801000000C3
  
  replace with:
  
  B800000000C39090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090 for Japanese
