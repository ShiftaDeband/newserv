From nol-rinale:
  PSOBB has an internal switch which allows the client to be set into 
  English or Japanese modes, this was the hidden switch Sega of America
  used to localize the game from Japanese.
  
  To enable it open the decompressed psobb.exe (it should be about 7MB) 
  in a hex editor and try the following:
  
  search for: 
  
  E82B91F4FF83F8017506B805000000C385C0750333C0C3B801000000C3
  
  replace with:
  
  B800000000C39090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090 for Japanese
  B801000000C39090909090909090909090909090909090909090909090 for English

Appended Language Code (according to the exe)
  _j
  _e
  _d (needs confirmation - _g? may be _g for files listed below, _d for map data? seems to be _g for map data. what is this line in the executable? typo?)
  _f
  _s
  _cs
  _ct
  _h (needs confirmation - _k? may be _h for files listed below, _k for map data? seems confirmed by data.gsl.)

Lobby Language Code
  J
  E
  G
  F
  S
  B (CS on PSOPC - seems to match executable? need to check known PSOBBCN screenshots.)

  K

Executable Lines/Notes - legacy strings for 'select language' from old versions of the game? changing things here doesn't seem to do anything.
