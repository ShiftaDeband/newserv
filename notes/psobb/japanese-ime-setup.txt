                Restore JP PSOBB original IME Behavior
########################################################################

The default Tethealla client included a custom patch to disable the IME
system in-game which allows you to type in Japanese (presumably to allow
English versions of Windows to type properly)

However, if you plan to play PSOBB in it's original Japanese language it 
is recommended you remove this patch to restore the original functions


Open a unpacked PSOBB.exe in a hex editor and:

FIND 9CC38E

REPLACE WITH A8838F


Make sure to install Japanese Language Support in Windows 10/11 to enable
the Japanese keyboard and IME.

If there's a problem, you can also use the Legacy IME by heading into the 
options of the Japanese Language settings and scroll down to the bottom of 
the page to enable Legacy IME Support to restore the original Pre-Windows 7
IME system. 

Last but not least, remember the default Tethealla client is the original 
Japanese client, so you don't need to apply any other special patch but this
one and make sure you have the original Japanese files set in your data folder
the game should start entirely in Japanese.
